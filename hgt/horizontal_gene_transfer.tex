\section{How does Genetic Change via Horizontal Gene Transfer affect Evolvability? (Proposal)}
\subsection{Introduction â€“ Draft 95}

Horizontal gene transfer is a mechanism by which organisms uptake genes or gene-fragments from the environment.  These gene fragments provide nutritive resources to the organism, and occasionally, gene-fragments from the environment are integrated into the genomes of the organisms, allowing the organisms to obtain new functions. For example, HGT appears to be the primary mechanism by which antibiotic resistance is conferred \verb| [ref]|. However, the origins and evolution of HGT mechanisms remain unclear.

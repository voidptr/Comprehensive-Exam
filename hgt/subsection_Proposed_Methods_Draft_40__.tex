\subsection{Proposed Methods â€“ Draft 40}

I propose to implement HGT within Avida \verb|[ref to the fiugre]|.  As organisms die, fragments of their genomes will accumulate in reservoirs.  The fragments in the reservoirs will deteriorate over time, with older genomes disappearing from the reservoir as new ones are accumulated. Fragments for uptake will be randomly selected from the reservoir.  

I will create two new mutagenic instructions to trigger uptake of fragments. One of the instructions will confer an energy bonus upon uptake, while the other will not.  Both instructions will incur a random chance of incorporating the fragment as an insertion into the genome.  If the insertion occurs, no energy bonus will be given. 

The energy bonus level, uptake mutagenic chance, and fragment size will be configurable per experiment.

\subsection{Proposed Methods}

I propose to implement HGT within Avida.  As organisms die, fragments of their genomes will accumulate in reservoirs.  The fragments in the reservoirs will deteriorate over time, with older genomes disappearing from the reservoir as new ones are accumulated. Fragments for uptake will be randomly selected from the reservoir.

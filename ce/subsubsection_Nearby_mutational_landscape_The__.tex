\subsubsection{Nearby mutational landscape}

The availability of reservoirs of formerly functional vestigial sites have significantly shifted the treatment-evolved organisms' location in genotype space such that a task lost due to mutation more often remains within one- or two-mutational steps away. In this way, the treatment organisms have a significant advantage over organisms in the control runs in terms of the short-term evolvability of the fluctuating task.

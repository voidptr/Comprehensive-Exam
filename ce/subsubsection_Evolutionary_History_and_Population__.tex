\subsubsection{Evolutionary History and Population Structure}

Organisms evolved in the hostile changing environment have a much longer phylogenetic history than those evolved in static or benign environments. At each environmental shifts, adaptive mutations rapidly sweep and fix in the populations.

Caption: Phylogenetic depth of population evolved in the static (control) environment vs that of hostile-evolved. Sweeps are marked by white horizontal lines. Control-evolved has a maximum depth of 400 ancestors, while hostile-evolved has upward of 1100.

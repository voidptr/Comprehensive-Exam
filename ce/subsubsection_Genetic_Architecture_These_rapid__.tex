\subsubsection{Genetic Architecture}

These rapid shifts result in qualitatively different architectural styles. Due to the continuous acceptance of adaptive mutations, the genomes evolved under both experimental treatments are much more scattered, with the bulk of the sites responsible for performing the fluctuating task (EQU) separated from the backbone task (XOR), except for a core region of overlap, which represent portions of the tasks that are shared between XOR and EQU.

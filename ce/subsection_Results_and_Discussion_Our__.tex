\subsection{Results and Discussion}

Our experiments show that digital organisms that evolve in cyclic changing environments differ substantially from those evolved in static environments in a number of key ways including their evolutionary history, genetic architecture and presence of plastic mutable regions that change the nearby mutational landscape.

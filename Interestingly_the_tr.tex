Interestingly, the treatment-evolved organisms also show development of a large reservoir of vestigial neutral sites, that is, sites that were previously active in performing a task, but were disabled by a mutation elsewhere.  These sites appear to be important for allowing the organisms to quickly adapt to the fluctuations in the environment. (fig. \ref{evomod_sitecount})

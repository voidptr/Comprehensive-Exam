\subsection{Methods – Draft 80}

For this research, we used Avidians that reproduce sexually. There are male and female Avidians, and the females choose their mates on the basis of a male’s displayed trait. In this case, a number between 0-128.
Both the choosiness target in females and the display trait in males are allowed to evolve. Males are selected based on matching of the trait, and only males whose display trait exactly matches the female target trait are chosen for mating. Only exact matches are accepted.

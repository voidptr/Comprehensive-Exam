Mating rates between populations is reduced to half of the within-population mating rates, indicating significantly reduced gene-flow. The mating rate is directly correlated to the difference in display traits between the populations, because it is the main factor in allowing females to discriminate between mates. 
Relatedly, we saw significant differences in the average display trait values between the isolated population.

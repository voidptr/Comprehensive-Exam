\subsection{Avida}

We use the Avida digital evolution platform to examine the various ways by which evolvability, modularity, and robustness evolves, and how these mechanisms affect the course of evolution.

Avida is a software platform for performing evolution experiments with digital organisms in a virtual world. The organisms are composed of a circular genome of assembly-like computer instructions that are executed in a virtual CPU. Populations of these organisms are placed in a toroidal world in individual cells, where they are allowed to execute, reproduce, compete for space, mutate and evolve.

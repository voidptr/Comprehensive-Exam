We surveyed the two-step mutational neighborhood of the organisms that lost function in the one-step survey. We found that in both the hostile and benign treatments, there were significantly more organisms that regained function in response to mutation than the control. [NOTE HERE ABOUT STATISTICAL TEST]. This indicates that it was easier for the organisms in the both treatment environments to turn regain the task in response to one additional mutation.

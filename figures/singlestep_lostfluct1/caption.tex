We surveyed the single-step mutational neighborhood of the organisms that performed the fluctuating task, and found that in the hostile treatment, there were significantly fewer organisms that still executed the task as compared to the control. [NOTE HERE ABOUT STATISTICAL TEST]. This indicates that it was easier for the organisms in the hostile environment to turn off the task in response to mutation.

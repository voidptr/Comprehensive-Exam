For the first series of experiments, I will create two new mutagenic instructions to trigger uptake of fragments. One of the instructions will confer an energy bonus upon uptake, while the other will not.  Both instructions will incur a random chance of incorporating the fragment as an insertion into the genome.  If the insertion occurs, no energy bonus will be given. 

The energy bonus level, uptake mutagenic chance, and fragment size will be configurable per experiment. 

For the second series of experiments, I will create a random mutation chance that triggers gene fragment update in the organism. This random chance will apply during reproduction, and offspring will receive the mutations.

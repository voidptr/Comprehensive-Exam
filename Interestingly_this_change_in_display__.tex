Interestingly, this change in display trait, and thus hybridization rates cannot be attributed to differential adaptation. 
The lack of statistically significant difference between the drift treatment and all other treatments indicates that drift is sufficient to generate difference in display trait, whereas the effect of differential adaptation is overwhelmed when compared to the effect of drift.

We measured the fitness and viability of offspring in forced mating trials.

Interestingly, both the benign and harsh treatment-evolved populations also show development of a large reservoir of vestigial sites; that is, sites that were previously active in performing a task, but were disabled by a mutation elsewhere and are now neutral.  However, these vestigial sites do appear to be important for allowing the organisms to quickly readapt as the fluctuations in the environment restore the previously-rewarded functions.

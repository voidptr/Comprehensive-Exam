The populations evolved in the control and benign environment displayed much more genetic diversity as compared to the hostile environment, which underwent what was effectively a bottle-necking at each cycle shift. Despite the higher amounts of diversity in the benign and control treatments, some preserved regions are still identifiable.

Per-Site Population Entropy over Time - Figure

Caption: Frequent sweeps resulting from harsh environmental shifts result in very low population and per-site entropy in the hostile treatment. This is the result of bottle-necking at each cycle-shift.

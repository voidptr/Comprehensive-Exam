\subsubsection{Nearby mutational landscape} These reservoirs of formerly functional vestigial sites have significantly shifted the treatment-evolved organisms' location in genotype space such that losing and re-gaining the fluctuating task is much more often within one or two mutational steps. In this way, the organisms have a significant advantage over the controls in short-term evolvability of the fluctuating task. (fig. \ref{evomod_landscaping})

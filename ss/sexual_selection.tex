\section{Speciation via Sexual Selection, and the effect on Adaptation and Genetic Architecture – Draft 50}

\verb|This feels like a pretty tenuous connection - I’m going to need to figure out how to reformulate this to make sense.|

\subsection{6.1 Background – Draft 10}

Sexual selection ubiquitous in nature.

Sexual selection is thought to contribute to speciation by allowing mates to discriminate against heterospecifics during mating choice.

Adaptive radiations and speciation are thought to be mechanism by which evolvability innovations spread into new niches.
